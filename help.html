		<h1>Help</h1>
		<p><strong>Note: This documentation is somewhat <em>speculative</em>, to put it nicely.</strong> The program is still in development.</p>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>To scroll around, hold down 'alt'. 'alt' is the key that says, 'Do the default action, ignoring Editabled alltogether.' Hold down 'ctrl' to edit <strong>anything</strong> in the editor. Right mouse selects colours from canvas, shift + right mouse selects tools from canvas.</p>
		<h2>Tools</h2>
		<table>
			<caption>All tools can be reassigned key values.</caption>
			<thead>
				<tr>
					<th>Icon</th>
					<th>Name</th>
					<th>Keys</th>
					<th>Description</th>
				</tr>
			</thead>
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td><img src="Editabled/crosshair cursor.gif"></img></td>
					<td>pencil</td>
					<td>p</td>
					<td>This tool draws a hard-edged line. Excellent for editing individual pixels, but the 'brush' tool should be preferred for broader strokes due to its smoother edges.</td>
			 	</tr>
			</tbody>
		</table>
		<h2>Saving</h2>
		<p>While you can save the page to your local disk, you can't read it directly back because of security reasons. You'll have to actually have a server serve it up to you, or disable that security feature. Images can be exported to .png format, or a URL for linking, and Editabled projects can be saved to .edt files for later editing and backup. Project files are automatically backed up &amp; listed locally. Your data is your own, to take care of and to keep.</p>
